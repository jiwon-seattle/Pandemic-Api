## 1. Pandemic API

The API contains Country and Status with one to one relationship
- Country has CountryId, CountryName, Latitute, Longtitude
- Status has StatusId, CountryId, Cases(Count number for people who affected from pandemic), Confirmed for true or false, and Date

Improvement Opportunities:
- Used package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies to enable lazy loading
- Stated addJason option in Startup.cs to ignore cycles that it finds in the object graph and to generate JSON response properly
- Used package Swashbuckle.AspNetCoredescribes for Swagger that describes the capabilities of the API and how to access it with HTTP

## 2. User Flow

1. A user is able to track pandemic per country
2. A user is able to track pandemic status of specific country
2. A user is utilize Pandemic API with full CRUD functionality   

Parking Lot:
- Overall cases for each country
- MVC implementation 
- Identity
- enhanced API authorizaiton

## 3. Development
### Tech stack:
+ [.NET CORE](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/) for package management (represents for C#, Entity Framework and Razor) 
+ [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919) 

### To run dev mode locally:
```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/jiwon-seattle/Pandemic-Api.git
  $ cd Pandemic
  $ dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -v 2.2.0
  $ dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -v 2.2.0
  $ dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies
  $ dotnet add package --version 5.3.1 Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
  $ dotnet build
  $ dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName
  $ dotnet ef database update  
  # After successfull pkg installtion
  $ dotnet run
```
Now, it will automatically open http://localhost:5000 and API is available on [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Swagger UI](localhost:5000/swagger)

You might encounter a MySql database related errors on initial loading since this application needs a specific data route to fetch data.
