## 1. User Flow

1. A user is able to track pandemic per country
2. A user is able to track pandemic status of specific country
2. A user is utilize Pandemic API with full CRUD functionality   

Parking Lot/Improvement Opportunities:
- MVC implementation 
- Identity
- enhanced API authorizaiton

## 2. Development
### Tech stack:
+ [.NET CORE](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/) for package management (represents for C#, Entity Framework and Razor) 
+ [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919) 

### To run dev mode locally:
```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/jiwon-seattle/Kanban.Solution.git
  $ cd Pandemic
  $ dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -v 2.2.0
  $ dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -v 2.2.0
  $ dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies
  $ dotnet build
  $ dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName
  $ dotnet ef database update  
  # After successfull pkg installtion
  $ dotnet run
```
Now, it will automatically open http://localhost:5000 and API is available on Postman or Swagger

You might encounter a MySql database related errors on initial loading since this application needs a specific data route to fetch data.
